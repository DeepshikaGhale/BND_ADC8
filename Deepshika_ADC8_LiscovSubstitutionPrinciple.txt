Liskov Substitution Principle:
Derived classes must be susbtitutional to the classes.
Inheritance should be applied wisely.

Code:
//super class
class Duck{
 swim();
 eat();
 makenoise();
}

class ToyDuck extends Duck{


}

class RealDuck extends Duck{


}

it voilates the rule of Liskov Substitution Principle.
So, the correct form would be:

class Duck{
makenoise();

}

class ToyDuck extends Duck{


}

class RealDuck extends Duck{
swim();
eat();

}
